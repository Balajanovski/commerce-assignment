        <strong>What We Stand For</strong><br>
        <p>
            The People's Education Party, PEP for short, is an Australian political party which mainly aims to improve the Australian
            curriculum. PEP believes that, in comparison with the rest of the world Australian children are left in the dust and that
            merely throwing money at the issue will not solve it. Money can buy better facilities and more teachers, yet it is the teachers
            which teach the lessons, not the brand new toilets, and that if the teachers are restricted to a sub-par curriculum there is nothing
            they can do.
        </p>

        <strong>Summary of our policies</strong><br>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The improvement of our education, not purely through funding yet by learning from other countries, and what they do that works.</li>
                <li>Bringing back a balanced society, in which neither political side are vilified for expressing their opinion.</li>
                <li>Encouraging a “work hard, be rewarded” attitude in schools within Australia. Australian children too often nowadays expect to achieve things by not working, and that everything will just magically fall into place without work.</li>
                <li>Creating more opportunities for intelligent children at school, by creating a selective school exclusive curriculum. Children who can achieve more should not be held back by their peers.</li>
                <li>Creating a more globally aware generation. Australian children are becoming less and less aware of the world outside Australia. By teaching about the whole world instead of just Australia, particularly in the subjects of history and geography, we can create a new, globally aware generation.</li>
            </ul>
